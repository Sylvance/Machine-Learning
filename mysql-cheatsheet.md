## Data Manipulation Language (DML)

update employee set salary = 1.2 * salary where employee_id = 1;
```

#### Delete a specified row
```sql
delete from employee where employee_id = 2;
```

#### Delete all rows
```sql
delete from employee;
```

#### Enabling foreign key checks
```sql
set foreign_key_checks = 1;
```

#### Disabling foreign key checks

select * from employee where salary < 4500;
```

#### Less than equal to(<=)
```sql
select * from employee where salary <= 4350;
```

#### Range

select * from employee where salary > 3000 and salary < 4000;
```

#### BETWEEN and AND
```sql
select * from employee where salary between 3000 and 4000;
```

#### Like Operator
```sql
select * from employee where name like '%Jo%';          -- Similar to *Jo* in regrex
```
```sql
select * from employee where name like 'Jo_';           -- Similar to Jo. in regrex
```
